This is a Ruby wrapper around the ifconfig command.  The goal is to make
getting any information that ifconfig provides easy to access.

It was developed on Linux 2.6 with ifconfig from net-tools 1.60.  The FreeBSD
support has been tested on FreBSD 9.2 amd64.  The package also has support for
SunOS, Darwin, OSX and Open, Net, and DragonflyBSD.  These have not been
thoroughly tested.  Non Linux platforms call netstat for interface packet
information.

Please send me ifconfig / netstat output for platforms that don't work.

see test/*.rb for usage examples.

Thanks to Peter Johnson for the *BSD examples
Thanks to Jeremy Tregunna for Darwin and DragonflyBSD support

INSTALLATION
------------

Please see the INSTALL file for details of how to install Ruby-Ifconfig

TESTING
-------
> rake
to run all the unit tests.

Prerequisites
------

You must have a working ifconfig binary in your path.
The output format of you particular version of ifconfig must be supported.
Currently this has only been tested with FreeBSD 9.2 and net-tool 1.6 on Linux.

Example
------
require 'ifconfig'

cfg = IfconfigWrapper.new.parse        # parses the output of ifconfig

cfg.interfaces           # returns list of interfaces

cfg['eth0'].addresses('inet')   # returns ipv4 address of eth0

cfg.addresses('inet')        # returns list of all ipv4 addresses

cfg['eth0'].status   # returns true if interface is up

cfg.each { block } # run a block on each interface object
